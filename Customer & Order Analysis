# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data

SELECT * FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID' 
LIMIT 20;

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE length(order_id) = 6 AND order_id <> 'Order ID' 
LIMIT 20;

#3. How many orders were placed  in January
SELECT Count(orderid) FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Show all account numbers for all orders placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(customers.order_id) = 6 AND customers.order_id <> 'Order ID';

#5. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Count(orderid) FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID' AND Product='iPhone';

#6. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and hat was the price
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price) FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#7. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, Count(Quantity), price, SUM(Quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product <> ''
GROUP BY Product;

#8. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln ST, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#9. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT Count(DISTINCT cxs.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN customers cxs
ON cxs.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2 AND length(orderid)=6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
